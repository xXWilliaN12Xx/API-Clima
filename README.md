## Motivation:

With increasingly noticeable changes in the climate and environment around us, along with the implications this has for nature, it becomes increasingly important to have accurate and up-to-date knowledge of climate conditions. This understanding goes beyond simple weather forecasting: it involves a deeper and more comprehensive understanding of climate trends and weather patterns. Given this, the idea of ​​creating a project focused on climate came up.
